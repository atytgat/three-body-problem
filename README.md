# Solving a three body problem using finite difference methods

We simulated a three celestial bodies system consisting of the Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn by solving the equations of motions with the Heun, Verlet, and Stoermer-Verlet methods. Each method has its benefits and its shortcomings.

This project was completed as part of the LPHYS2371 Simulation Num√©rique course followed at UCLouvain in 2017.

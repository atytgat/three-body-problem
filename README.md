# A simulation of Saturn and Jupiter orbits

Simulation of a three celestial body system consisting of the Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn. This was realized by solving the equations of motions with the Heun, Verlet, and Stoermer-Verlet methods. Additionally, a comparison of the benefits and shortcomings of each method was presented.

This project was completed as part of the LPHYS2371 Simulation Num√©rique course followed at UCLouvain in 2017.
